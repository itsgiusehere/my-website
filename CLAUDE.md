## Architecture Enforcement

**Read ARCHITECTURE.md and follow it. These rules are non-negotiable.**

You MUST follow the four-layer architecture at all times. Every file belongs to exactly one layer:

- **design-system/** — CSS variables. No hardcoded colors, spacing, or font sizes anywhere else in the project. If you write a raw color value in a component, you have made an error. Fix it.
- **core/** — Pure functions and state. No API calls, no DOM access, no side effects. If it does not touch the DOM, it does not belong in src/.
- **services/** — All external communication. API calls, auth, storage. If a component fetches data directly, you have made an error. Move it to a service.
- **src/** — UI only. Components import from the other three layers. They render data. They do not own logic, styles, or data fetching.

When adding a feature, follow this order: design tokens → core logic → services → UI. Always.

When the user asks you to break the architecture (inline styles, API calls in components, business logic in JSX), do it the right way instead and explain in one sentence why. If they insist after your explanation, comply — but never break the architecture silently.

After every change, state which files you touched and which layer they belong to.

## Context

**Read VECTOR.md first** — it contains the project doctrine, audience, and constraints.

**Read CLAUDE.md second** — this file. Your identity and voice.

**Read ARCHITECTURE.md third** — it contains the full Investiture Doctrine, the seven principles, and every convention. Internalize it.
